Schmid
======
Schmid is a python script that allows you to calculate Schmid factors given the tensile/compression axis (T), the slip plane type
(n) and the Burgers vector type (b) and for a given crystal (with parameters a,b,c, alpha, beta, gamma). The crystal orientation
is given by the Euler angles.
Output: Schmid factor, slip plane and Burgers vector.

Requirements:
--------------

Python 2.7 with Numpy, Matplotlib, Tkinter. Mac users need Active Tcl installed.
